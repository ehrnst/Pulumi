# Azure resource group and storage account

This is a slighthly modified example which is generated by default from Pulumi.  
I have added in parameters for the storage account to show how to control namings etc. The `resourceGroup` is just the reference within your Pulumi stack. And not the actual name for the resource group. This reference name can be changed and used to your liking.  

I have also added in a storage container and changed parameters for the names and enabeling `HTTPS Only` on the storage account.
